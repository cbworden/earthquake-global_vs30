The Makfile will create a grid file and a weighted clipping mask suitable for inserting the
California Vs30 map into the global Vs30 map.  See the Makefile for
specifics of the processing.

Note, this Makefile sort of "cheats" the workflow for most coastal regions (Greece, Italy, etc.)
and should not be used as a template for other coastal regions. This is because the shape of California 
along the coast can be tightly bounded, so even though it DOES still smooth the coast outside of California, 
it is negligible since it has to smooth the border between California and Oregon anyways (including at the triple junction
of Cali, Oregon, and the Pacific). We just cut it off so the smoothing doesn't go any further up the Oregon coast.

To create the necessary files to display the new California Vs30 map, simply type

	% make

in this directory. To insert the new California map into a global Vs30 map,
return to the top level directory and type

	% make

To create the plots, type

	% make plots

To clean things up, type

	% make clean

Or just

	% make clean_plots

to only remove the plots.

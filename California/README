The Makfile will create a grid file and a weighted clipping mask suitable for inserting the
California Vs30 map into the global Vs30 map.  See the Makefile for
specifics of the processing.

This Makefile is one example of a regional map with coastline - however there are
several unique problems associated with the values given for water in the original
map that must be addressed individually in the workflow. It could be a useful
exercise to take apart the Makefile line-by-line to understand how the final
product is formatted.

To create the necessary files to display the new California Vs30 map, simply type

	% make

in this directory. To insert the new California map into a global Vs30 map,
return to the top level directory and type

	% make

To create the plots, type

	% make plots

To clean things up, type

	% make clean

Or just

	% make clean_plots

to only remove the plots.

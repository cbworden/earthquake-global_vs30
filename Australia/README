The user should select one of the hybrid Taiwan maps by making the 
appropriate edits in ../Constants.mk. The Makfile will then create 
a grid file and a weighted clipping mask suitable for inserting the 
Taiwan Vs30 map into the global Vs30 map.  See the Makefile for 
specifics of the processing.

To create the necessary files and insert them into the global map, run
make in the Slope directory first, then in the other directories that 
you want included in the map, and then here you can simply issue the 
command:

	% make

Note that it is easier to achieve these results from the Makefile in
this directory's parent directory.

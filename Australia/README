The Makfile will create a grid file and a weighted clipping mask suitable for inserting the 
Australia Vs30 map into the global Vs30 map.  See the Makefile for 
specifics of the processing.

Note this is a good example of how to create a Makefile when your regional map is 
just an island. 

To create the necessary files to display the new Australia Vs30 map, simply type

	% make

in this directory. To insert the new Australia map into a global Vs30 map, 
return to the top level directory and type 

	% make 

To create the plots, type 

	% make plots

To clean things up, type 

	% make clean

Or just 

	% make clean_plots

to only remove the plots.

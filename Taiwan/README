The user should select one of the hybrid Taiwan maps by making the 
appropriate edits in ~/.vs30/Constants.mk. The Makfile will then create 
a grid file and a weighted clipping mask.  See the Makefile for 
specifics of the processing.

Note this is a good example of the (trivial) problem of inserting a 
region which is an island into the global Vs30 map. 

To create the necessary files to view the Taiwan map, simply issue the 
command:

	% make

in this directory. To insert the new Taiwan map into a global Vs30 map,
return to the top level directory and type

	% make

To create the plots, type

	% make plots

To clean things up, type

	% make clean

Or just

	% make clean_plots

to only remove the plots.

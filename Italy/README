This directory creates a grid file and a weighted clipping mask suitable
for inserting the Italy Vs30 map into the global Vs30 map.
See the Makefile for specifics of the processing.

To create the necessary files and insert them into the global map, run
make in the Slope directory first, in the top level directory simply issue the command:

        % make

To create only the Italy Vs30 map and not insert it into the global grid, 
simply type

        % make 

in this directory. Also, type

        % make plots

to create and view the intermediate steps.

The Makfile will create a grid file and a weighted clipping mask suitable for inserting the
Italy Vs30 map into the global Vs30 map. Perhaps just behind Greece, is a good Makefile to look at to understand
the workflow for regions with coastlines. This one is a bit more complicated than
Greece because it "fixes" (similar to the lakes in the Iran map) two problem spots.
One spot is Venice, where there is a discrepancy between grdlandmask and the way
the authors created the map (explained below), and the other is a small, square
region in Sardinia where the authors did not fill in Vs30 values.

To create the necessary files to display the new Italy Vs30 map, simply type

	% make

in this directory. To insert the new Italy map into a global Vs30 map,
return to the top level directory and type

	% make

Similar to Greece, to understand the workflow for coastal regions by viewing the intermediate steps, type

	% make plots

To clean things up, type

	% make clean

Or just

	% make clean_plots

to only remove the plots.

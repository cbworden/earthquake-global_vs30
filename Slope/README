To make the global slope-based Vs30 map, simply run make:

	% make

in this directory. Note that as part of the workflow, 
Greenland is pre-processed to a uniform value of 601 m/s. 
This is simply to make it a unique value, since the topographic
slope-based method doesn't do well in such a large flat (ice-covered)
area. This value can obviously be changed or even removed from the 
workflow, if needed.

If the 7.5 arcsecond resolution map is desired, the user 
should update their Constants.mk file ("RES" variable), and 
then in this directory run:

	% bash 75_commands.bash

to create the global topographic slope-based Vs30 map. This
step does not include the Greenland pre-processing fix, but 
can be added.

This directory calculates uncertainties in Vs30 for every
location in the slope-based and hybrid global maps. 

The relationship used to calculate uncertainties in the slope-based
areas is described in Seyhan et al., 2014. 

The relationships used to calculate uncertainties in the hybrid map
are unique to each region, and sometimes unknown or unconfirmed by 
the author of the regional map. Those relationships that are known
include:

XXX - ;asodnf
XXX -a;ksdjn
XXX - a;sfn

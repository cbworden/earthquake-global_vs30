The Makfile will create a grid file and a weighted clipping mask suitable for inserting the
Iran Vs30 map into the global Vs30 map.  See the Makefile for
specifics of the processing.

This workflow includes resolving particular "problem regions," typically
caused by differences in the way the map was made compared to the way
gmt's grdlandmask command works. In this case, the authors of the map
gave two small lakes NaN values - consistent with their other use of NaN
for all water (oceans, lakes, etc.). However, grdlandmask does not recognize
these two lakes, so we manually fix it. That workflow is described in the Makefile.

Please note this also uses the "coastline" methodology since some small parts
of Iran touch the coast. If that is the case for your region, you will need
to do the same for accurate values near oceans.

To create the necessary files to display the new Iran Vs30 map, simply type

	% make

in this directory. To insert the new Iran map into a global Vs30 map,
return to the top level directory and type

	% make

Plots here are not as detailed as for Greece or Italy (as in, they don't show the 
intermediate steps like those do). Regardless, to show the plots type

	% make plots

To clean things up, type

	% make clean

Or just

	% make clean_plots

to only remove the plots.

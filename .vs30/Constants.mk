# The output map resolution in arc-seconds (RES) and decimal degrees (RES_DD);
# both of these must represent the same resolution; the GMTED2010 is available 
# in 30, 15, and 7.5 arc second resolutions (0.008333333333, 0.004166666667, 
# 0.002083333333 degrees), so those are good choices; other resolutions will
# require makefile modifications.
# 30c makes a global file that is approximately 3GB
# 15c makes a global file that is approximately 12GB
# 7.5c makes a global file that is approximately 46GB 
# In all cases the disk space required to construct the map is at 
# least ten times the final file size (unless you go step by step and
# clean up as you go).
#
# NOTE: If you try to make the 7.5c map and run into memory problems
# (and you very likely will), see the file "commands_75.txt" in the 
# Slope directory for a way to make the map in two pieces and then
# stitch it together. If that's still too big for your machine, you
# can follow the pattern there and split the map into four or more
# pieces. I didn't build any of this into the Makefile because it's
# just too complicated and a couple of years from now everyone is 
# going to have a machine that can handle the full grid.

# --Taiwan_Vs30_AW09gk_30c.grd uses a baseline model from topographic slope
#   (Allen & Wald, 2009) and is then adjusted for the mean residual in each 
#   geologic unit and then the residuals are kriged.
# --Taiwan_Vs30_PRG_30c.grd uses a 'hybrid trend' with a slope that is allowed

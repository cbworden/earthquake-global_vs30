This directory downloads shape files from the J-SHIS web site and then
creates a grid file and a weighted clipping mask suitable
for inserting the Japanese Vs30 map into the global Vs30 map.
See the Makefile for specifics of the processing.

To create the necessary files to view the new Japan Vs30 map, simply type

	% make

in this directory. To insert the new Japan map into a global Vs30 map,
return to the top level directory and type

	% make

To view the plots, type 

	% make plots

To clean things up, type

	% make clean

Or just

	% make clean_plots

to only remove the plots.

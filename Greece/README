The Makfile will create a grid file and a weighted clipping mask suitable for inserting the
Greece Vs30 map into the global Vs30 map.  See the Makefile for
specifics of the processing.

This is the most comprehensive Makefile (along with Italy) for understanding the
workflow used when adding regions with coastlines. The process is so extensive
because we do not want the coast to be smoothed (i.e., where land touches water we want
a sharp boundary), either inside or outside of the new region. BUT we do want the new region 
to be smoothed into the rest of the background map. So, we have to creatively smooth only 
where new Vs30 land values touch old Vs30 land values, but not where either touches water.

To create the necessary files to display the new Greece Vs30 map, simply type

	% make

in this directory. To insert the new Greece map into a global Vs30 map,
return to the top level directory and type

	% make

Crucial to understanding the workflow for coastal regions by viewing the intermediate steps, type

	% make plots

To clean things up, type

	% make clean

Or just

	% make clean_plots

to only remove the plots.

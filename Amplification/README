This directory contains the Makefile to create an amplification map
using Vs30 values from the global grid. Current runtime on a standard 
workstation is approximately 25 minutes.

First, build the global grid by typing 

% make

in the top level directory. Then, switch into this directory (Amplification) and type

% make

to create the amplification map.

To create the plots, type

% make plots

To erase the amplification map and the plots, type 

% make clean

Or to erase only the plots, type

% make clean_plots

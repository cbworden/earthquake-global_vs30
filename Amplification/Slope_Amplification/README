This directory contains the Makefile to create an amplification map
using Vs30 values from the slope-based global grid. This is not included in the top-level
Makefile, so it can only be made (and cleaned) here. Further description can be
found in the top level README.md file. Current runtime on a standard 
workstation is approximately 25 minutes. This is basically the same script
as the new hybrid Amplification map, but it corrects the path to
read from the Slope directory, which contains the slope-based Vs30 map.

First, build the global slope-based grid by typing 

	% make

in the top level directory (note, you can also do this quicker by just 
typing % make in the Slope directory). Then, switch into this directory 
(Amplification/Slope_Amplification) and type

	% make

to create the slope-based amplification map.

To create the plots, type

	% make plots

To erase the slope-based amplification map and the plots, type 

	% make clean

Or to erase only the plots, type

	% make clean_plots

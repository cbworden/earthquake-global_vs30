This directory contains the Makefile to create a ratio map
using amplification values from the hybrid and slope-based global grids. 
This is not included in the top-level Makefile, so it can only be made (and cleaned) 
here. Further description can be found in the top level README.md file.

First, build the global slope-based and hybrid grids by typing 

	% make

in each of their respective directories. Then, switch into this 
directory (Amplification/Amplification_Ratio_Map) and type

	% make

to create the ratio map of Hybrid/Slope amplification values.

To create the plot, type

	% make plots

To erase the ratio map and the plots, type 

	% make clean

Or to erase only the plot, type

	% make clean_plots

This directory contains the Makefile to create an amplification map
using Vs30 values from the global grid. This is not included in the top-level
Makefile, so it can only be made (and cleaned) here. Further description can be
found in the top level README.md file. Current runtime on a standard 
workstation is approximately 25 minutes.

First, build the global grid by typing 

	% make

in the top level directory. Then, switch into this directory 
(Amplification/Hybrid_Amplification) and type

	% make

to create the amplification map.

To create the plots, type

	% make plots

To erase the amplification map and the plots, type 

	% make clean

Or to erase only the plots, type

	% make clean_plots

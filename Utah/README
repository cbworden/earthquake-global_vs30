This directory creates a grid file and a weighted clipping mask suitable
for inserting the Utah geology-based Vs30 map into the global Vs30 map.
See the Makefile for specifics of the processing.

Note this is a good example for adding a region that is completely landlocked. 
The complicated workflow for not smoothing coastlines is not needed. The only 
thing we add here is a "buffer zone" around the region of the originally provided
grid file, which helps with smoothing.

To create the necessary files to display the new Utah Vs30 map, simply type

	% make

in this directory. To insert the new Utah map into a global Vs30 map,
return to the top level directory and type

	% make

To create the plots, type

	% make plots

To clean things up, type

	% make clean

Or just

	% make clean_plots

to only remove the plots.
